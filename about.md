At New Graph Environment we provide practical and innovative environmental research and consulting solutions. We strive to build and maintain working relationships with proponents, scientists, First Nations, stewardship groups, non-profits and regulators through sound science, open communication, integrity and value-added deliverables. We are biologists and computer programmers that develop collaborative open-source programmatic water quality and fisheries analysis/reporting tools. We will continue to facilitate aquatic ecosystem restoration with an emphasis on inclusive engagement and knowledge sharing.

We are building relationships with government, industry, consultants, First Nations, fisheries professionals to gather information on local priorities, identify areas of ongoing effort for diverse initiatives, to share project data and build awareness of opportunities. We have documentation of over 30 separate meetings with a diverse mix of regulators, First Nations and stakeholders including FLNR, DFO, Office of Wet’suwet’en, Gitskan Watershed Authorities, the Environmental Stewardship Initiative, Morice Water Monitoring Trust, CN Rail, Ministry of Transportation, BCTS, Upper Bulkley Streamkeepers, local landowners, etc.
